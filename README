Espyo's miscellaneous Pikmin tools.

Each tool should have its own documentation, so this file will just serve as a general README.

These are Python scripts. To run scripts that involve images, you'll want to install Pillow. Use pip for this.

List of tools:
    Hey! Pikmin save editor: Exports .sav files into an editable json format, and imports the json back. (Python 3)
    Pikmin 2 title tool: Helps you create title screen Pikmin formations. (Python 2, requires Pillow)
