Espyo's Pikmin 2 cave parser

Read the "Miscellaneous Pikmin tools" parent project's README for more information.

The purpose of the Pikmin 2 cave parser is to give Python programmers a function (read_cave_from_file) that reads a Pikmin 2 cave file, and outputs an object of a class (Cave) that contains all of the parsed data.

The following is a usage example. This is a script file in the same directory as p2_cave_parser.py, and should be run with a cave file as an argument.

import sys
from p2_cave_parser import *

if __name__ == "__main__":
    cave_data = read_cave_from_file(open(sys.argv[1], "r", encoding="utf-8", errors='ignore'))
    
    s_nr = 0
    for s in cave_data.sublevels:
        s_nr = s_nr + 1
        print("Sublevel " + str(s_nr) + " has the following in TekiInfo:")
        for o in s.teki_objects:
            print("  " + o.obj_class + " (minimum amount of " + str(o.min_amount) + ")")
        print("")
