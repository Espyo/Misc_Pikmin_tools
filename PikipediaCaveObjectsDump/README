Espyo's Pikipedia cave object dump script

Read the "Miscellaneous Pikmin tools" parent project's README for more information.

This script reads a cave file and outputs a text file that represents the cave's objects in MediaWiki wikitext format. It was made for Pikipedia, so that I could add the list of objects and their amounts to Pikipedia's cave pages, as well as a more detailed list showing what gets spawned, in what order, what chances, etc.

The script's output isn't perfect, but it's good enough for general purpose. Sometimes some manual tweaking is necessary, and for a lot of cases, the script will actually detect some edge cases that are too confusing or complex to implement, and will instead write a message on the command line so that the person running the script can be warned about those cases.

This script makes use of the Pikmin 2 Cave Parser project, so there should be a "P2CaveParser" folder in the same folder as the script.
